# AI-Powered-Interactive-Chatbot
This chatbot utilizes NLP techniques and deep learning to understand user intents and generate responses. It preprocesses text using tokenization and lemmatization, employs a deep learning model with dense layers and SGD optimization trained on JSON-labeled intents, and provides interactive chat through a Tkinter GUI.

Usage
Setup:

Install Python and required libraries (nltk, keras, tkinter).
Place intents in JSON format in intents.json.
Training:

Run the script to preprocess data and train the model.
Save model files (words.pkl, classes.pkl, chatbot_model.h5).
Run the GUI:

Execute the GUI script to start chatting with the chatbot.
Enter text in the input box and press send to interact.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
nltk, keras, tkinter
